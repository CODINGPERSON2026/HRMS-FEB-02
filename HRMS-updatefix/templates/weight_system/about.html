        <div class="doc-content">
            The Weight Management System helps track and manage weight data of soldiers efficiently.
            It calculates ideal weight ranges, identifies fit/unfit personnel, and provides detailed
            analytics by rank, company, and category. The system enhances health monitoring and reporting.
        </div>

        <div class="doc-title">User Guide</div>
        <div class="doc-content">
            Instructions for using the system include adding users, viewing dashboards, 
            checking fit/unfit statistics, and generating reports. Users can filter data by company or status type.
        </div>

        <div class="doc-title">Technical Documentation</div>
        <div class="doc-content">
            Built with Flask (Python) and MySQL. Frontend uses Bootstrap and Chart.js for responsive UI 
            and dynamic graphs. Backend provides REST APIs for data management and computations.
        </div>

        <div class="doc-title">How Fit/Unfit is Calculated</div>
        <div class="doc-content">
            The system calculates a soldier's fitness status based on their actual weight compared 
            to an ideal weight determined by their age and height:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Round the height to the nearest even number.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look up the ideal weight from predefined tables based on age and height.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate the acceptable weight range:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The weight range can be more than 10% of the actual weight</li>
                        <li>The weight range can be less than 10% of the actual weight</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Compare actual weight to the range:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If actual weight is within the range → Status = Fit</li>
                        <li>If actual weight is below or above the range → Status = UnFit</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Calculate weight deviation in kg and percentage for unfit personnel.</li>
            </ul>
            This ensures accurate monitoring and reporting of soldier fitness for each company and rank.
